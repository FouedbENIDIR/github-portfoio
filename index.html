        Hi! My name is Foued BENIDIR, and I am currently enrolled in my final year of an engineering cycle at ESIGELEC (Rouen, FRANCE), majoring "Medical Devices Engineering" (ISYMED program).
      </p>
      <p class="lead animated-text">
        During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn and practice subjects like mathematics, physics, IT, Electronics, computer sciences and engineering sciences. 
        I also had the opportunity to apply my academics knowledges on several modules related to medical devices, such as:
        research projects,
        final year project, but also 
        medical compliance, including European norms (ISO 13485, 14971) and regulatory affairs.
      </p>
      <!--<p class="lead animated-text">
        During this school period, I also worked on various projects, improving skills like meeting deadlines, managing budgets, and collaborating in teams.
      </p> -->
      <p class="lead animated-text">
        My goal after graduation is to continue working to improve my skills, gain technical competences that really matter and that are useful for people.
        his is why I am currently seeking a 4-6 months internship starting spring 2025 (or earlier if necessary) as engineer to work on projects that really matter.

As chief project, I led the development of an Implantable Movement Tracking System intended to restore motor functions. We are currently designing a concept using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and developed a functional prototype. In collaboration with stakeholders, I co-authored the functional specifications using Agile methodology, managing task planning and delegation within the team. I also conducted patent research and carried out a state-of-the-art review of existing implantable IMU solutions already on the market. Additionally, I created the technical architecture of the system, ensuring compliance with ISO 13485, ISO 14971, and CE standards. Throughout the project, I applied relevant standards, including IEC 62304, IEC 60601, and IEC 62366, to ensure software quality, safety, and usability. As part of this project, I also participated in the Med'Ing Hack 2024 health hackathon, where my team and I were awarded first prize for our innovative solution.";

By identifying critical points and suggesting areas for improvement, segmentation allows for a detailed evaluation of the surgical process. This idea is based on a study published by Despinoy et al. (2015), titled 'Unsupervised Trajectory Segmentation for Surgical Gesture Recognition in Robotic Training', which introduced a series of tasks to segment gestures and perform gesture recognition. During this project, I conducted a state-of-the-art review of AI applications in medicine and attempted to reproduce the experiment using more optimized deep learning algorithms. The project is still ongoing, and the results are expected to be available in January. This work was developed as part of a school module called Surgical Robotics, at the end of which a research paper is expected and will be presented to a jury.";

My main responsibility involved collecting, transforming, and formatting medical images (MRI, PET, X-ray) into datasets (DICOM, MRD) using Python. These images came from various universities, including Bergen, Valencia, and Stanford. I applied image degradation techniques, such as blur, contrast adjustments, motion artifacts, and noise, using image processing algorithms in Jupyter Notebook. I also developed a Google Form and PowerPoint presentation to facilitate expert evaluation of 600 degraded MRI cases, utilizing Non-Referenced Image Quality Assessment (NR-iQA) methods. In addition, I conducted statistical analysis and authored reports in LaTeX via Overleaf. My work contributed to ongoing research, and I will be a co-author in the upcoming publication expected in 2025.";

My team and I aimed to review and reorganize the previous work, identify useful elements, and structure it into smaller projects to be proposed to next year's teams. My principal preoccupation was to identify the parts that had been the most developed by previous groups, such as the in-house printed electronic circuit. Over the two months we worked on this, we divided the tasks into four main areas: mechanics, electronics, data acquisition (focusing on anatomical aspects), and software. As the project lead, I was involved in all parts, but I focused more on refining the electronic circuit and improving the data acquisition processes. I redesigned the PCB based on feedback from previous teams and learned how to optimize EMG placement for maximum efficiency. All the work has been documented, achrived and pulled on GitHub repository, available for futur groups. From our work, we successfully developed six smaller projects that can be assigned to other groups(2 on IT, 1 on data aquisition, 1 on electronic, 1 on mechanic and 1 on regulatory affairs). Two summer interns have worked on one of these projects, and a new group is currently working on the acquisition project that we developed";

The goal of this module, apart from learning the different aspects of signal processing, was to ultimately create a MATLAB program to analyze provided signals and draw conclusions about their nature. To achieve this, I used various basic MATLAB functions (fft, ifft, etc.) to process the signals and plot them, resulting in the illustrative picture above. The signals were recorded from EEG, and our goal was to prepare them to be used for point detection, enabling the control of a keyboard solely by watching on a particular key for a certain period of time.";
